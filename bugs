I just want to write down an anecdote that could be potentially useful later:

I'm dealing with the following bug. The second time my Game loop( while true) goes
around, I encounter a segmentation fault on my Move function. When I debug it
I realize that a crazy address is being passed to the function as the FROM param.
I thought this was a problem with the memory deallocation the Move function
produces when a piece is captured, but the problem also occurs when no piece is
captured, or even when no valid move is made. The problem was actually in how
I read my input. The getchar() function the second time around, was reading
garbage rather than my input, so the index put on the board array where crazy
high and low (like 54 and -47) which pointed to a random null point in memory.
